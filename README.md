# Celebrating Black Lives
## AM10 Data Visualisation | Study Group 10

We will celebrate the **achievements of African-Americans**, breaking the colour barrier across a wide range of topics.

The data we analyse can be found in the `data` folder.

### Visualisation Ideas
- timeline of important breakthroughs
- analyze how "Firsts" are distributed over categories (i.e. Politics, Education & Science, ...)
- visualise how historic events (Civil War, Civil Rights Movement, ...) impacted African-American society
- augment the data and run geospatial analyses (where happend the breakthroughs?, ...)
- augment the data and run analyses by gender
